interfaces of automation blanket where sky meets Earth
mems research funded, promises to stem seizures
of material scarcity, from Aleppo reaching across to the Bering Seas
Blood harvests, they'll squeeze us til we barely breath
I know cats who speak Basque, their perspective is different
cognition is shifted via omniscient linguistics
look around, constructed languages from fiction crowd out
indigenous sentences, no one suspicious of emphasis
how its not a premises / of naked supremacy
nations aged by only centuries unleash plague as if its meant to be
and me, mentally, I've been taught to obey
walls and fences, laws of princes, edicts course through my veins
with no caution I'm forced to welcome and garnish my pain
harness our myths and manuscripts to offer my name


To this aimless stupor, they computers calculate to game the users
dangle fortune and fame to strain the sutures
when we asleep they classify dangerous truth of
Great forgettings, creating endings or ancient futures

industrial parks slotted for accelerated trade agreements
where waste seeps into sources of where people drinking
Manufacture of exotic materials, lasers scan the serials
metrics replace imperial, arrays map out the aerials
while nation states prepare to box with velvet gloves
scarcity ensures black markets for elephant tusks
demands stacks carcasses upon a melted crust
don't call it selfishness, forces that envelopes us
It replicates as we do, innovates as we do,
in those ways of people, few pass through heads of needles

Arm chair elites fully invested in Austrian economics
Hurl troops in metal cockpits over third world tropics
botulism from falling drop ships further they grip on sovereign entities
To spot foreign enemies, we use organic chemistry
Its blind violence but we pay them no mind
Until we realize we live next to a coal mine this whole time

To this aimless stupor, they computers calculate to game the users,
dangle fortune and fame to strain the sutures,
when we asleep they classify dangerous truths of
Great forgettings, creating endings or ancient futures

Golden rules can't apply when we living neck and neck
My brothers up in arms, sisters going check to check
Power ball up in the millions, so many plan to be next
But Can't afford to pay off they gambling debts
Officers outfitted with chain link over meta materials
formations set up for fear, impose mega imperials
Towers stacked of glass inhabited by living Viscera
Sync circadians to electric antikytheras
Instead of factoring costs of the arrangement
billions remaining have to deal with weathers changing

Demographics can't adapt fast enough, lacking hap-tic feedback
When super storms are the norm who you call for evac?
Ceremonies unveil new coliseums due to dovetails
Won't revitalize superfund sites or save rust belts
Instead of living, we flow in ecologies of the prison state
Known Universe, in a protracted struggle for a different way

If they cant Control the streets they press control alt delete
Absolutely unaware that this history repeats
some blame science for killing god, same science as building blocks
frames and pylons revealing thoughts,  replace arbitrary with deeper laws
Regression back to mean labelled unsophisticated
though we able to tease information from unspecific cadence
shifting of Earth underneath what we've built
silent thunderings that ripple and liquefy the silt
we deconstruct and simplify, signs write the end is nigh
time spent on diamond mining means most were meant to die
for low wages, the profaneness Of new idols that are famous
promote products that are dangerous, divert funds for sports stadiums
of course  sieges continues on peoples who have most to lose
when we only have one option what are we supposed to choose?
Of course people are erased for the sake of development
when these words have no meaning the truth is irrelevant

Nautilus feels the present unwinding,
does it coil peacefully or foment Peasant uprisings,
from exchanges within alleys or updates of public Ledgers
no concern that the fiat cannot be measured

When our ties to what sustains us are severed
Then it seems what survives lives under pressure,
In terms of currency, only assurance can be treasured,
temperatures won't be tempered as long as we the center

Extract energy leaking from steam turbines,
chrome leeches into aquifers, but its not the first time
General malaise is common for the middle aged
they gaze up towards the sky to trace commercial spaceships
Formations that ferry supplies and few that will survive
in zero gravity inside castles in the sky
Causalities of war, ignored as thermal losses
generals reap rewards as both sides filling up coffins
Over speakers its relayed that they can search us
underneath the earths crust, with alternative service
Employment is a joke now that processes Automated
scrappers strip junk for carburetors, antiques with altered carbon dating
Skin color or genitalia, updated star of David
They pour out they hearts for comrades who never made it
ahistories from stonehenge to the Olmec
soulless drones that are tone deaf prepare for war that is full fledged

Nautilus feels the present unwinding
does it coil peacefully or foment Peasant uprisings
the exchanges in the alleys or updates of public Ledgers
no concern that the fiat cannot be measured
When our ties to what sustains us are severed
Then it seems what survives is what is measured
In terms of currency, only assurance can be treasured
The temperature won't be tempered as long as we the center

like light through Optical molasses, we shine bright
but stuck inside this element that's captured
us, suspended, as beam of pure energy
our core entities, separate/ labelled as sure enemies
if you live in the jungle, our mechanisms will hunt you
come through your habitat with bibles and guns too
we got our own idols, tactics of Sun Tzu
balance lost forever, once you undo
patterns passed before the fall, great forgetting before recall
we came, we saw, now planes free fall
above lanes we pour with cement, we've evolved
To weather storms of acid rain as trees dissolve

Neural pathways remain intact, language acquired through rough syntax
so what divides our kind from recent pasts?
Hardware unchanged, no leaps in math
Just creatures navigating on uneven paths

matter of fact, change is in software, not our code that makes us
our science won't save us, our hubris sedates us,  Where will it take us
now that we are sure we are the first
as well as the last that must last on planet Earth
	
We all return to Earth at the end of our sentence
body turns to dirt, a form without sentience
most play out their time in the bosom of modernity
built upon those serving 25 to eternity
Concrete pens with no warmth, no human contact
captured trophies of memetic combat
sagas reduced to monochrome time lapse
legacy surrendered to the abyss like by catch
I think of where I'm at, the privilege
to choose between decadence or a divine path
my mind has binaries, but contrary to good and evil
Truth is molded within the hearts of a people
no need for proof, nonexistence of absolutes
what's the use, if water turns to flame, forests reduced to roots
dot a man-made landscape, a metal dome for a roof
they replaced our home encased our physicals in a tomb
Attempts to bury us in this grave site called America
vocal ones silenced, local genocide in each area
Air supremacy,  Nagasaki to Syria
drop the bombs to augment the hysteria

They declare Open season on those with no allegiance
Why is it treason to oppose these broken meanings?
When the pretense chosen to uphold the presets
Is outmoded, who provides content, what is downloaded?
They declare open season, on those deemed a malfeasance
why is the reason untold in the books that they be teaching
when the precinct becomes the source of the guns
that be killing the young, cover our eyes to what really is done

That brilliant sun don't shine for  civilian slums
where chances you make it out: a million to one
before urban sprawl unchecked merge the coasts into a suburb
methane runaway ensures the coasts are going under
the summer means no comfort in a heat island
minor riots are quelled by red blue leviathans blaring sirens
department budgets begin to siphon funds
meant for schools/ become the tools for more violence
let a fire burn in Philadelphia
let workers earn fractions of what they selling ya
Automation spells the end to even the service economy
to buy and sell is worth more than our autonomy
Plastic packaging flattened, mixing with autumn leaves
after winter passes it'll be a silent spring
When blood and sweat valued less than jewelry
black outs and power surges, these urges, it supersedes
Rigs far off shore drive deeper,
murky coasts are patrolled, populated by mine sweepers
All gains absorbed by our appetite
live like there's no tomorrow, but there's an afterlife
who can break cycles if they don't got patterns right
but its hard in the caverns light to See when shadows strike


They declare Open season on those with no allegiance
Why is it treason to oppose these broken meanings?
When the pretense chosen to uphold the presets
Is outmoded, who provides content, what is downloaded?
They declare open season, on those deemed a malfeasance
why is the reason untold in the books that they be teaching
when the precinct becomes the source of the guns
that be killing the young, cover our eyes to what really is done

The views they promote to stoke sectarians
god fearing Americans, lie in wait hoping to open wide carrion
To poke and prod closed in rot, expose the clots
decay ain't supposed to stop, as a global stock
matter of fact, they working overtime
first there's birth, then contours we supposed to climb
that cable package makes you passive
Catharsis they label fashion
Retreating forests, heating arctic
seas of garbage leech reactants
Most struggle to survive, we can't see the carnage
Some come to the divide retreat a carcass
There's too much at stake with my views it seems
false history causing nation states to do these things
Whats more they collude with producers which produce these dreams
Now my face be the enemy on the movie screens
Black death to yellow perils, my accents to my apparel
From back when people's feralness became captive or sterile
I read signs of the times, they claim eye for an eye
my foreign kind, scapegoats to bleed for their crimes
Militias enforce the right reasons, democracy to white Jesus
freedom is profit to destroy Eden
whats our options, to spectate live or later streaming
Run for cover or partake in the open season
	
They be boosting gear, non detection through fluids
no proof of fare, or how and when they do it
Invisible to infrared sensors that be hovering high
Weaving between speakers that be thundering lies
Nobody wondering why, this is a new normal
a view of black skies over burning blocks where few quarrel
got magicians driving stick forging huge portals
into other worlds of no forests and few coral
Bulbs of Edison, walls of medicine
halls accredited fallen presidents, Call it what it is
marble stripped to serve a function
it's those who write codes guiding those who reap and sow onions 
What are dreams, if not hope and or lessons to be learned
When there's no coping mechanism to deter
fantastic notions to return Us back to equilibrium
we only focus on the worst

This is the zero plane where bodies fear no pain
Where we drink blood cuz it's ten years no rain
Look in the distance, this place with no name
This is the zero plane, this is the zero plane

I'm in a room full of stolen treasures
where we keep pharaoh tombs as well as golden feathers
next we mining moons with emboldened effort
try to bring monsoons over Gobi deserts

Have had my head down since mid December
in and out of city centers
Routed via aqueducts, I've seen decay beneath the opulence
How much of infrastructure run on Sweat equity
We re-purpose muscle fiber to achieve feats incredibly

Focus, sharp as fangs of king cobras
Cranes that careen over mountains of machine boulders
Pirates who eat locusts sail to breach ghost ships
Fail those who be closest, as a whole it seem hopeless
Like dissolves like, types evolve types, 
Stuxnet activate/ crawl networks to hard wipe,
Seeking intrigue or increased dividends like PG&E
Chains of command infiltrate take hold deep in the streets

This is the zero plane where we breath in Kerosene
Where we drink blood cuz it's ten years no rain
Look in the distance, this place with no name
This is the zero plane, this is the zero plane

Pistons elicit hissing as bronze solder worn down
Qld city quarter torn down for new views few can afford now
voices barely audible under the horn sounds
deafening decibels signal caution in the foreground
microparticles diffuse from numerous rock heaps
cause tumorous colonies to be dealt with in future policy
workers cannot sleep on threat of termination
Fatigues insures at least one a day perish within basins
carved bed rock, layers of history  expose
piles plunge down as caverns are enclosed
patch works of pipes, panels upon roof tops capture the light 
Dynamic stasis, basis between masters and mice
Outside on display Racks of 3D bearing beads
Back alley Gene therapy with lucid dream guarantees
We lost, like Greeks coming home flying bleached sails
Lost, far from home like beached whales

This zero plane where we share the plague
Where we drink blood cuz it's ten years no rain
Look in the distance, this place with no name
This is the zero plane, this is the zero plane
	
Language is imperfect, but first it's about furthest
points that encourage us to curse at our purpose
Inabilities connect, instabilities collect
Insofar as we detect, indeterminate regrets
Through life we progress, how many breaths before death
how any sight of the flesh give ways to flights in our chests
Christ atop the crest, stories retold a thousand fold
now it's hold is solid from atop pyramids to down below
other people's we've encountered from Amazonia to the Poles
are gone now, so their stories are true unknowns
What machinations drive us to scorch earth in times of peace
What fascinations drive us to orbit celestial beings
We can see Neptune's rings, Titan's icy sheen
Look back at a blue marble with growing deserts, drying streams
It's neural wiring, or nucleic acids in our Genes
or Freudian conditioning's, leaving traces in our dreams
I've heard it's inside of us, our nemesis, since Genesis
the premise is, we must pay a pound of flesh for our blemishes
If I head west it's a tax that I offer to a God
Eternal souls put on trial, as a scythe reaps the crop
Or I cross east towards lands where internal strife is our flaw
Suffering is managed but suffering is the law
Do we strike a balance to find a middle way?
In this Search between latitudes for answers that fit our fate?
Pray on our knees that president's launch missiles straight
Pay our fees to participate in trade on interstates
Soaked inside of binaries like I'm swimming in custom silicon
between ascetic discipline to doubting bone and ligament
Can I tell what fiction is? Verses what my sickness is?
Born into affliction, many names elders have christened it
My egos plus my people's born and raised neolithic
I am trained Neolithic, taught to behave Neolithic
I recite creation myths that retain Neolithic
Assumptions: I'm cradle to the grave Neolithic
And in this case, reality we create lends credence
To new ideologies that blur the lines of sequence
12, 000 thousand years is just a blink of an eye
Yet 5 millennia makes us think we can defy
Nature, out and inside, excuse me but English ain't precise
Or vague enough to handle what it is this world provides
I'm blinded by rage, using my pain as my sight
Without no awareness I thought this was the meaning of my life
To suffer our sins as well as buffer all delights
Shifting baselines means we live one another's rewrites
Desire is the root, what we believe is what we do
Never mind that this belief structures us and shapes the truth
So now what I am left with, means and methods we've accepted
To ancestors I'm indebted, concepts of hell and heaven
It's over, this chapter it can come to a close
Abolish my anger against Coptic symbols inside of scrolls
Leave my attachment to Sutras that taught me exactly that
diamonds are merely geologic aftermath
Nautilus been on a quest but is it time to reflect
It's easy to rip out pages of manuscripts Naut rejects
Instead of east west I'm headed back before Cartesian
Back before genome sequencing, back before the breach of sin
Back with awareness my lens is warped by the present
Forever war with my essence, with cores of my tenets
Myopia induced by voids of time in my conscious
I need to bridge gaps as well as grasp the coming conflicts
Go between the pasts, really my present, and my futures
Go between the pasts, what I can't ask the Diamond Sutra
I go between the pasts, I'm searching for a path
	
The sentience begins its final reference
cross checked, free of human negligence
silos emptied undetected, wash away the decadence
a second flood, the wrath from above beckons blood
future archaeologists uncover no mention of us
Only buried cities caked by layers of dust
black shafts that once rise above now collapsed and crushed
they find sunken layers, early graves of the unprepared
tracks of creatures on foot en masse running scared
The Geiger detects traces of Armageddon
The depths is where even the strongest went in
excavations uncover a global death sentence
species erasure, evidence of a total threat and menace

What did they leave behind? what did we leave behind
the monolith is all they'll find

Piece by piece, events can be reconnected
databases resuscitate survivors tales of tempest
it's a mystery why the black slab still imposes
while the rest of the planet remains frozen
biospheres have long since collapsed due to melted permafrost
once the machine was set in motion there's no way to turn it off
So by millions, refugees built underground
And to this day, they remains still underground
densities of  the lairs compares to meat packing
powered by nuclear fission left to boil, still reacting
Fallout spreads, from slums to middle class buffer tenants
cracks from fracking, leaking carcinogenics
Into springs that hydrates the last of the labor class
due time their inside burn and return to ash

What did they leave behind? what did we leave behind
the monolith is all that they'll find
What did we leave behind? what do we leave behind
the monolith is all that they'll find
What did we leave behind? what do we leave behind
the monolith is all that they'll find
What do they see above the sea and sand
the monolith is all that stands

Details are teased from secondary sources
an orifice in the slab still active, detail coordinates
machines made subordinate, only to rule through relieving boredom
Transmit through antennas that rise beside forklifts
domed habitats, perverted dymaxion
No difference between civilized men and what they label savages
to protect the last of private property
A dead system won't teach you how to live properly
privatized police mechanized, deployed rapidly
They run on solar, don't require no batteries
Cyborgs made to feel, paid to kill
the masses that inhabit these caves of steel
it was systematic, the way they caused havoc
in the face of total chaos there's no way to stay passive
in due time all fit the profile for death sentencing
created conditions to justify their own necessity

So what did we leave behind?
Only tapes and records, time don't rewind
What did we leave to find?
Only dates without context, a sun that don't shine
What did we accomplish?
In our extinction we had no accomplice
What did we leave for future witnesses
A silent world is our final monument
	
What's consensus? Convergence towards truth or merely projections
Of past biases and complexions
Now instead of priests, there's new gate keepers for direction
Nautilus doubt the research and raise the questions

I was taught man descended from the tree tops
Great apes before our brains gave way to harbor deep thoughts
Straight legs on great plains we speed across
With straight aims we maintain prowess with lethal force
Before history who controls what is known
Cave paintings relate mainstream theories of Western codes
As a male, I'm evolved to hunt game and fight wars
My counter part, gather carbohydrates and are what I fight for

We chased mega fauna until they no longer breed,
Like how we burn coal In factories so we no longer breath
Like indigenous holocausts so we no longer see
How we divorced from ourselves So earth no longer speaks

Competition on all levels is what gives us our drive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
And we living this til the day that we die
From the cradle we supplied til the grave that we lie

I've only known what my eyes can see
my mind is free, to swim in this entire sea
But what if I'm only drifting by a tide beneath
Break away to dive deeper to find what's inside of me

I was birthed encased in vernix, white film on my surface
Same as sea mammals that are born in ocean currents
I swam before I crawled, dived  before I walked
Controlled my breath inside my chest before I learned to talk
My physiology performs like I was born by the ocean
Savanna's are foreign to my forebears locomotion
Some claim our brains swelled due to consuming flesh
Mistake omegas for alpha in how we used to catch
Catfish in Turkana, mussels of coasts of Java
New bones in our ears we've uncovered between strata
Iodine, iron, zinc, selenium
Fat subcutaneous, to the fat in our craniums
On our bodies, it's the placement, in our head, it's the matrix
Our brains of DHA reflect complex social arrangements
This world of pavement, Industrial enslavement 
Contained by the blade when its chalices that form the basis

I've only known  what my eyes can see,
my mind is free, to swim in this entire sea,
But what if I'm only drifting by a tide beneath, 
I break away to dive deep into what's inside of me,

As an emcee, Naut got that breath control
Adaptation that was crucial as a stepping stone
Same trait i share with clades of cetaceans
enables communication, As I rhyme to a cadence
Enables me to speak Your evidence corrupted
On behalf of worldviews Victorians constructed
you think your objective, I can see your objectives,
I reject your directives as I dive into depths with
Stories of people's who lived free of good and evil
Darwin aboard the beagle, emissary of medieval

We can push back against blind Faith in a process
That Reduce complex into objects and fuel conquests
telescopes to search heavens defile sacred mounts
Wide eyes confirm a vastness while this planets breaking down

High science is skewed vision like we got deformed corneas
landfills in the ocean means plastic in mother's formulas
Aspirin in the rivers, fructose in the livers
Acid when it rains, what we gain with no more winter

Claim no Confirmation bias, they must be double blind
Overturn theories, but what is true cuts through time
They say they want proof but it was never bout evidence
About severance, between human and everything
How can we know our past if we relish in Erasure,
Enforce the Secular that drive us to meet our maker
Collapse of water bodies reveal how far we've come
Our war against ourselves tribute to all we've done
I don't know that I'm right but I know that they wrong
We won't go without a fight, all my people's stay strong

Keep our heads above the froth, ahead of hidden costs
Speak of the forbidden until the instance we reach across

I've only known what my eyes can see
my mind is free, to swim in this entire sea
But what if I'm only drifting by a tide beneath
I break away to dive deep into what's inside of me
	
How do you recognize the ordinary?
What do you call that without a name?
Why do we ask for answers without a question?
Where do we go if every where's the same?

Acid fumes escape from old batteries
assault your olfactory, landscape is soul shattering
Clear cut by old strategies, fly ash buries untold savagery
the globe a hot zone pocketed by cold cavities
Boulevards are set to not intersect axis
cultures clashing, vultures nest next to ancient trash heaps
survivors are basically marathon athletes
go round and round in circles, cross country through the back streets
wearables track consumers to relay parametrics
that chip in the wristwatch, gridlock delays paramedics
mole people live underneath encased in damp septics
culture transmits the message: existence is a death wish

xNautilusx, an engineer, telling you the end is near
but first pause, dissect cause and effect, are intentions clear
ingrained with the notion that humans are created flawed
in all of evolution we are chosen after all
we flew too close to the sun, so we had to fall
whether original sin or within our DNA, we have to war
neighbor against neighbor, fall to guns or sabers
believe in science or saviors, no difference within this group takers
hands that have toiled, deformed by labor and stress
roll cigarettes, inhale fluid into the chest
cant afford to purchase tobacco, she burns cloves as a substitute
Her clothes are aren't comfortable, bestowed by the undertow
Non profits feed in the Sub-currents and undergrowth
Ghettos to prison pipelines, we forced to lie underoath
Metal worms crisscross under you, hear the undertones
this embargo of perspective: highly functional

All I see is the ruins
All I breath is the ruins
All I eat is the ruins
All I meet is the ruins
All we see is the ruins
All we breath is ruins
All we eat is the ruins
All we meet is the ruins

Along the coast brown men break ships with no benefits
mangled bodies Fill the tenements
20 hour shifts, there's no end of it
Coffin makers pace back and forth taken measurements
Plasma cut crusted brine and score panels oxidized
copper from miles of wire line the side, while missionaries proselytize
No how what when and the why,
this design, only those who have consolidated decide
to escape the baking sun while they synchronize the pull
groups congregate in shadows of the crumbling hulls
spears of commerce now merely scrap metal
 world is flat, after these giants made the map level
All it takes is a spark to ignite hermetic chambers
No compensation if they suffer mortal danger
another dead Asian, a chapter brought to close
worldwide suffering, but these stories remain untold

How do you recognize the ordinary?
What do you call that without a name?
Why do you ask for answers without a question?
Where do you go if everywhere's the same?
How do we recognize the ordinary?
What do we call that without a name?
Why do we ask for answers without a question?
Where do we go if everywhere is the same?

A city within a desert built to flaunt its buried treasures
by any measure, they networks protect the net worth
few voices past the censors, as diseases transmit through dense vectors,
senses inert, seek out pain and pleasure.
Droves of immigrants tricked, beholden to private ventures,
stolen wages, passport pages, modern slaves, these faceless members
As degrees of separation drops, more weeds will grow between the crops
more rapidly viral content spreads between nodes within our thoughts
what we see is filtered by whims of a central user
more misguided than visions of retro future
These servers run the kernel, the surface wraps around inferno
no concern for what is earth and the loss of what is fertile
Claws of drought have caused a storm of dust to descend
the city walls a poor defense for beginnings of the end
Cause we out of options, the final shadow descends
but are we sure of the outcome, I guess it all depends

All I see is the ruins
All I breath is the ruins
All I eat is the ruins
All I meet is the ruins
All we see is the ruins
All we breath is ruins
All we eat is the ruins
All we meet is the ruins
	
What is the missing linkage? 
My cities shrinking due to shifting seasons
who knew that used nuclear fuel brews for fifty eons

as fields lay fecund, my ancestors slayed chieftains
raped and seeded demons who further created kingdoms
These coastlines reclaimed by encroaching oceans
fires beyond hills are only omens, like ghost
we move back in forth, between constructed worlds
based in imagination or ones that drains the source
Megastructures crystallized from seeds of pure chance,
machines speak in FORTRAN, habeas corpus with no warrants,

Upon this earth, they speculate upon its worth
dismantling biospheres along they search

We speculate, what's tomorrow will be today
Quantify derivatives so value can be retained
Never mind extinction, it's value that remains
Never mind valleys it's the peaks we seek to aim

Opiates funneled by motorbikes upon a Khyber pass
while in Berlin my man Eebz cash out his cyber stash
Blac bloc in DF leave scenes with police tires slashed
Shout out to my fam in Kampala, thick as a briarpatch

are these actions fruitless? Just to make them upset
know our history, like Studying for a blood test
We forced to do battles with shadows on the wall
shrapnel that resolves historical ripples of the Gauls

myths of the Noble savage, symptoms of global madness
split beams like focal fractions, now fade out into blackness
imprisoned like blackfish, we can't have this
how we speak of Earth in the past tense

We speculate, what's tomorrow will be today
Quantify derivatives so value can be retained
Never mind extinction, it's value that remains
Never mind valleys it's the peaks we seek to aim
We speculate, what's tomorrow will be today
Quantify derivatives so value can be retained
Never mind extinction, it's value that remains
Never mind valleys it's the peaks we seek to aim

Purging colons, ignore thirst, hunger, massaging swollen
abdomens, these riches they fly over like locusts ravaging
The budget deficit, lack cold storage for medicine
tent cities emerge under crumbling concrete edifice
power cut off by con Edison
our lives under the knife by non sentience
line of sight enigma is the deadliest
Reflected off the space needle, correlate or co-variance
Establish Task forces, keep under wrap losses
tracks our passport and monitor from floating warships
we get by on smaller portions, as my spine begins to bend
We pay for their fortunes, trades for future dividends

We speculate, what's tomorrow will be today
Quantify derivatives so value can be retained
Never mind extinction, it's value that remains
Never mind valleys it's peaks we seek to aim

Splinter cells put projectiles through the choppers roof
with increasing frequency like how Dopplers do
know your family, and who's robbing you
no humanity is no virus, it's the cop in you
to enforce peace they ignore grief,
to quell unrest, subsets  effectively quarantined
youth is sedated to make way for machines
elders are orphaned, nothing more* than corporate streams
of revenues, central news turn mammals into vegetables
like canned food, it preserves no nutrition using chemicals
Never climb for no reason, seek alphas to lock in gains
Never mind extinction, it's value that remains
Never climb for no reason, another rush another trade
Never mind valley it's peaks we seek to aim
	
Carbon based evolution, an original OS
data bytes in my DNA be a minimal codec
Whatever augments you supply better be backwards compatible
I peruse the catalogue to review new latitudes
Forget exosuits I'm in the market for extra limbs
A second pair of arms, add on extensions to my shins
Custom control, zero latency through native terminals
10 meter minimals, unlocking new verticals
For new muscles, I need scar networks of wetwork
Plus spider silk in my sweatshirt, keep me conscious through pressure
Allay G forces, nano bots in my bloodstream,
So oxygen distribution optimal when I'm gunning
micro textures to deflect spectrum's visible via naked eyes
Optical camouflage baked into my makeshift hide
For vision, precision is part of basic packaging
Upgrade to mixed reality, eyes supplied by* human trafficking
Multiple feeds compete for composite balancing
Cortex overclock addresses nonlinear analysis

Capillary dilation, muted blush response
We shaping up as entities from just beyond
Our primitive streaks contain variables for infinite tweaks
Commensurate to how much you spend on this day of the week

Deep brain stimulation to retrain configurations
retain information, relay a new fragrance
Custom pheromones tailored for wireless transmission
As defenses against cybernetic schisms
A way to set fire to the prisons// of thought
Cash deals for discount, no taxes included in the cost
Foreign smells Produced by new organelles
back up stem cells in case organs fail
Insurance premiums are obscene and meaningless
that's why back alley body mods for knock offs are teeming with
teams of feeble men foraging for illegal gems
high risk high reward in this arms race we competing in
Before they raise the scalpel, you gotta raise capital
Rate based on surgical planes, horizontal or sagittal
This ain't where office workers come rehabilitate thoracics
Engineers are the users, scientists perform magic, 
Improvised for renegades to the weapons grade
no fool suffers second place, night market deals during retrograde

Capillary dilation, muted blush response
We shaping up as entities from just beyond
Our primitive streaks contain variables for infinite tweaks
Commensurate to how much you spend on this day of the week
Capillary dilation, muted blush response
We shaping up as entities from just beyond
Our primitive streaks contain variables for infinite tweaks
Commensurate to how much you spend on this day of the week

I've saved up half a year, now it's time to strike a bargain
My man Jai shot me facts on the shortages and margins
I'll settle for titanium over composite carbon
Can live with extra weight, cap ex is where I target
Need stents for nerve flossing, reserved lymph's that reverse caustic
And enough copay for my 6 month diagnostic
Take pro hormones to catalyze mass aggregation
I seek stronger serums with fast activation
Chasing the state of the art, on display we break what we are
second livers for your cirrhosis, My LDLs I pay no regard
I'm in it to transcend hayflick limits, to stray from finish
Survival greed, strong take from victims
Plant based, my colon edited to break down cellulose
Microbiome fortified now my ferments are self enclosed
Maybe next year I'll be bleeding edge, if I breach the head
There's still a mile to shop around before I reach the end

Capillary dilation, muted blush response,
We shaping up as entities from just beyond,
Our primitive streaks contain variables for infinite tweaks,
Commensurate to how much you spend on this day of the week,
Capillary dilation, muted blush response,
We shaping up as entities from just beyond, 
Our primitive streaks contain variables for infinite tweaks,
Commensurate to how much you spend on this day of the week

Chasing the state of the art, on display, we break what we are
A false assumption that it's either stasis or we compete to evolve
My quantified self tells me a horror story
Every second sentence mentions epilogues to former glory
Is this life? beats per minute as I sit tight
confined In a cubicle as I transmit bytes
Is this life? It don't matter on this night
The market is open and I scoping for the best price
	
We commute to the surface from under the grid
winter's bite is tempered by heat from furnaces
street furnishings illuminated from turns of the switch
end up in an urn or a ditch, the glitch burns when it hits
a fire-sale that leaves neighborhoods darkened
only the lost or a fool will be caught walking

unaware of the eyes that stalk them
the laser beams and the scent of flesh that marks them
Elevated tracks roar with each pass of grinding steel
hell on wheels, over looking cracks

which act like sinks attracting lost items
and harvests which the harshness brings
some pan for gold, on they knees searching
crate fires, dance shadows upon the street urchins

Some be hungry, fatigued from the streets that curse them
some be missing persons, some wounded from wars, no one to nurse them

finding refuge among the refuse but not security
another homeless dead, beaten mercilessly
we kill for sport, anothers pain we will ignore
if numbness is virtue what you have feelings for?

I feel the cold rain as it begins to pour
just caught in the middle of the storm
I feel the old pains make they way to my core
just caught in the middle of the storm

We get cut down, crushed by upper echelons
Packed into the hexagon
No matter why you pray, what you say, where you stay, how you stray
You still trapped in the hexagon

They lead legions, to carve out new regions
it’s the season of the scorpion
scorch the leaves and leave the carbon unsequestered
in all of time this is just an excerpt
augment the body with chrome and organic gadgets
got radio and telescopes encircling the planet
no body planned this, pollack on the canvas
no guides no directions that are written in the Sanskrit
I watch a culture stagnate, adults drinking’ lactate
eating’ crab cakes, suffer back pain gaining mad weight

The age of division is what we enter now
Nautilus stays underground with les miserables

the raw elements cause settlement, building’ up the pounds
black bloc response to release of the hounds
Patterns in the labyrinth drawn by past savages
point to solutions that will bring down the averages
There's no narrative to tie together,
millennia of tragedy, history a grim specter
It’s irony that the theory of the domino
culminates in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo

Saddam Hussein is slain, another obstacle put out the way
this chain is unstoppable, underway
feel the climate change, these may be the final days
no resting place beneath the tidal waves

We get cut down, crushed by upper echelons
Packed into the hexagon
No matter why you pray, what you say, where you stay, how you stray
You still trapped in the hexagon

They drive black cabs with black hub caps
sporting the black plates, riding with black masks
got the anthrax gas within backpacks and duffels
keys and pills they smuggle to weaken the struggle
The doors they kick down, the shores they invade
the wars they construct to keep us in chains
And now they enslave us with gene splicing
control our food, control when the fruits ripen
alert levels heightened, a thousand rounds of metal to pierce the chitin
exterminate the herds like they did the mighty Bison
There is no romance to the way we be fighting
human striking human who don’t be like them

There is no romance in crime and extortion
honest people buried underneath the warren
in addition to the storm troopers, officials plot and collude
with yakuza, ms bruser, thugs, and terrorist
wherever the dream is American
the hexagon leads, there is no comparison
wherever the dream is American, there's fear and sin
all of us, the hexagon rearing in

We get cut down, crushed by upper echelons
Backed into the hexagon
No matter why you pray, what you say, where you stay, how you stray
You still trapped in the hexagon
Scientists hinted at a middle earth existence
that we all sense, what we do as a scale of symptoms
molecules or strings it makes no difference
A universe expands as futures lay unwritten, or is it?
Illusions, past and present really are non-sequential
scales come unbalanced in experimentals
zoom out, see this plane through a lens that is tenfold
quasars calibrate coordinates like sentinels, now
machinery keeps a whole world lit up
at night we sit up, no sleep just business

commerce, trades vying for local supremacy
might makes right, the way its meant to be
streets obscure many entities with pot hole engine steam
benevolent machine is many things
from scales of the nano to scales of the piano
these words cut deeper than paths of river channels
our lives on the anvil, forged by flames or discarded to landfills
of course pain is pardoned by how time can standstill

We can make sense of the scales if we make sense of ourselves
Make sense of the scales if we make sense of ourselves
Make sense of the scales/ make sense of ourselves
Make sense of the scales/ make sense of ourselves

Blood fills a cove along migration routes,
Death spreads from a fishing people's to adjacent towns
Algal blooms uptake all dissolved oxygen
cull involved operands, no more cauldrons of collagen
Phase shifts be given this world a face lift
Pearls we've wasted, merely sand encasement

Weighed then appraised on scales at remote points of sales
From aquaculture ventures to reach throats poised and frail
To prove make we scratch glass, to move weight react fast
We tube steak, sentient meat all action but no use case
To repel death some can pay to scale Everest
While they contemplate scaling market share via leverage
Diabetics Synthesize insulin inside of crevices
Overhaul Entire metrics, titrate vital remnants
we've summoned revenants to cope with Failure states
Our skin turns to scales as we enter what hell awaits
 
We can make sense of the scales if we make sense of ourselves
Make sense of the scales if we make sense of ourselves
Make sense of the scales/ make sense of ourselves
Make sense of the scales/ make sense of ourselves

What are we now, just a bio-film stretched to form fit
fossils of urban orbits, forced to forage like flies among orchids
Naut atop the fortress, through monoculars spot the warships
Corvettes, in formation to threaten water sources
Liquid percolates, cleaned by top soil that's still good
No more Reverse osmosis cause we can't produce the filters
Ions across the membranes, cross cuts across the  end grain
Cost us the forests now my culture has no end game

value crisis in times of need, blame ourselves condemn our seed
to transmit myths - humans: monolithic in how we see
It's not that scales limit us, in fact the scales limitless
Lets overstand exactly what it is scales have given us
In every part of the whole, there's a whole of the part
If we deny this then we live with a hole in our hearts
In every start of a flow, there's an end that can grow
Can this scale, time well tell how far this can go
Our stories are just a few that can scaled across the globe
Lets tip the scales for different tales, so other worlds can unfold
	
nautilus practice advanced analytics, my eyes glance past the limits
surpass any cynic, that round insufficient digits
Sacrifice precision only to waste time with symptoms
Design prisons, split us apart like light through prisms
We live under crushing weights of isosceles, written into existence
western prescriptions of philosophy
poverty we suffer, in material and spirit
packed so close together but none familiar with nearness
forced to be fearless inside copper mines with no equipment
Buried at sea when your body expires during shipment
what is this? culture spread in the most lethal fashion
legends of Eve and Adam have us all believe in madness

We going full blast
Don't settle until we got the full stack
this sprawl they gotta pull back

Now its no longer who solders and who pulls the breaker
Who sold the sacred, full stack with open data
We going full blast
Don't settle until we got the full stack
they sprawl they gotta pull back

Now its no longer who solders and who pulls the breaker
Who sold the sacred, full stack with open data
There ain't no fall back, Known Universe
we call that like paying your salt tax in all cash
I never lost track, rake through arbitration and alt facts
Clovis was Carbon dated as a wrong match

Inflated coffers fund Kevlar stitched under gore-tex
good thing after pyrotechnics you just left with scored flesh
Skim tops off like transactions in the Forex
Well versed as a quartet, as drone s deliver to our doorsteps

Set up comms to send encrypted databytes
2 way communiqués inside dead satellites

Hunt for deals, at least a black edge or better
Hyperbolic discounts, tracking the ledger
Are you a friend of me, or an enemy
big data overlay to overload my sensors
These memetic beings
resistant to bio degradations, afforded macro-views
of insurrections stamped out across the pavement
Austerity creates vagrants who find shelter among quarries
inhaling salt mixed with chlorine sprayed from quad copters soaring



We going full blast
Don't settle until we got the full stack
this sprawl they gotta pull back
Now its no longer who solders and who pulls the breaker
Who sold the sacred, full stack with open data

Neoprene off gases to Violate ASHRAE standards
safety seals will tampered,  investigations will be hampered
They'll look for Anthropocene within beads of Amber
conclusion, increase in cancers among prayers unanswered
A renegade Stuxnet, reach for a hundred plain suspects
each with a hunch that they unchecked
As if Dengue spread through wifi and usb
Receivers run fevers, heat maps reveals intrigue
It ain't after centrifuges, as most spin empty
it's investing, time, energy, in different settings
Hedge against the condemned, penned by devils rope
Your rent in debit affects your credit quotes
We sip a credit yoke, amassing forces that threaten folk
You just a cell from when you woke to your name set in stone

These streets seen more battles than Eyes of Xenophon 
We don't battle demon spawn, we have to seek a calm
I keep my people close, but I keep my heat closer
Talking about thermals, what you think? That I'm packing toasters
We can't see them but we battle full blown creatures
Been around before the mounds of Cahokia
To blast through it's crucial we cover all verticals
Full stack crews, we base reality, not just virtual
	
the Known be blasting
vegan edge cats on the beat, one on the rapping
living among the madness in a world run by madmen
 
It wasn't Much back then if you arrange verbs to flow
now the mission statement is about making this universe known
Most trapped in the crap shoot, finding beauty in gold
quote unquote precious stones, Building moats around they homes

the illusions be producing altered states of security
methane in the tap from frack retains its purity
secret prisons torturing, water board for information
free us paper chasers from dodging unmanned drones aiming

We live in times where every day is uncertain
The burdens of modernity means we only learning
How to get by, its time to open up your mind
The known universe emerges through emergent design

We live in times where every day isn't guaranteed
The struggles in streets, smoke from flesh doused in kerosene
Its not enough to survive, its time to open up your mind
The known universe emerges to service our kind

Fiberoptics underneath the seas relay petabytes
cybertronic parasites prep for the end of life
as we know it, our maths will outlive the poets
poison gas mixed in with snow drift as the ozone opens

UV rays concentrate, stray satellites collide escalate
a chain reaction, there's no relaxing
world war means chains of command promulgate
to raise the taxes, to slay the masses, creating havoc

island nations have been uprooted now they drift with the currents
nuclear truce as deterrence against foreign ships determined
to defend contested sea routes, or They try to reroute
only cold blood for ones we got to leave out

How many more quarters until the stocks hit their targets?
Cause Market price don't reflect the true cost of the carnage
we be armed with more than a mind
if you go against warriors its war you will find

this world offers more but machines bottle up its nectar
they wanna mine asteroids for ores to construct the death Star
eyes to the sky with bodies wrapped in Kevlar
The Known Universe, We see farther than the Kepler



We live in times where they watch us from the tower
Externalize scarcity, so they charge us by the hour
Soft power can be broken, its time to open up your mind
The known universe emerges from the start of time

We living in debt, live off our sweat and see no rewards
When existence is a threat, I guess there is no recourse
Against creators of this mess who have no remorse
The Known universe,  we the tour de force

Masses pay homage to overarching Mother culture
its just cover for blood lust upon another alter
from troops in Malta in transmit to bring stability
to the planet, use of force as a course of civility

we'll forever pay increasing amounts tribute
loyal to the grave, but how we behave ain't the issue
its coming for your kinfolk, fiending for your tissue
its takes an unseen hand to guide the flying missiles

Its clear that the beast is implacable
so we spread out across the land like seeds of the daffodils
a shift in priorities, no more dialogue
no future in these networks controlled by Viacom

to work within the system is to work within they vision
no perfect search for wisdom but preferable to they prescriptions
The crimes they commit daily just the raise the tension
it pays to keep populations less than sentient

We live in times where the air is unfit to breath
Where corral reef competes for sunlight with the plastic in the sea
We got one life, one struggle, one fight
Until all are liberated so let's make sure its done right

We living in times where the heart is discounted
Broken mathematics drill oceans, remove mountains
Collective suicide, its time to do or die
The Known Universe, in struggle, see through truth and lie
	
We call this a home, untamed, untouched by human memory
We call this our own, unnamed lands pristine throughout the centuries
We call this destiny, chosen peoples invented dreams
fight or flight, might makes right, there's no empathy

I was not born here, but call me a native son
White saviors with right behaviors to change these native ones
You got spears, I got guns, you got land, I got funds
You often offering us more of what we already won

I know my place, among higher consciousness my mind relates to
divine rights of kings my kind stay faithful
ill betray you, my word is worth less than your myths
Your gods you forfeit, your options now: Forget or forgive
your stories not important,  learn ours, imported, paint borders
now we cordon off forests to make our fortunes

When our blood mixes, counter to survival of the fittest
create castes, sub-systems, anguish within genetic suspicions
Weaponize diversity, history's verses forget the worst of me
My name will be an anniversary
furthering, trauma inter-generational
struggle for meaning, with no stated goals

you find no hope where only hatred grows
colony rot, let me ask who will take control?

We call this a home, untamed, untouched by human memory
We call this our own, unnamed lands pristine throughout the centuries
We call this destiny, chosen peoples invented dreams
fight or flight, might makes right, there's no empathy

My eyes dazzle by reflections of glass monuments
Statesmen who slayed communists, patriarchs of the populace
Annotated environments means less you know
keep pumping by any means, like stilts in my ventricles
Facades dimensions are form found and calculated
To blend shadows, return on investment is calibrated
To the tenth decimal, we are fed powdered vegetables
Buy and sell seconds, never mind hours in our schedules

My man squire makes a living fixing boxing matches
Said its better for his habits, cant float on Walgreens' average
Hes hooked on caffeine, but we all got to up our output
From code monkeys to hired hands reeling in halibut
But by how much? Saline solution to jogs memory
cells remembering, to wake and stop the hemorrhaging
Mistake ancient artifacts as bones of dragon
We cloned for brackets, ingest unknown reactants
Study graphs for Omens shown to match with
Same shock waves that block free flow of traffic
We call this a home, untamed, untouched by human memory
We call this our own, unnamed lands pristine throughout the centuries
We call this destiny, chosen peoples invented dreams
fight or flight, might makes right, there's no empathy

Lay of the land, punctuated by unmarked
Graves that we've slated to span

Operations through where perch breed, we mustn't awaken the clans
Porous pipes that spill poison right Where they've taken a stand
Its imperative, forget what's Aryan or American
we need areas to mine fairy dust, a false hope will carry us
Our armies return damaged, traumatized and in tatters
we told them to win battles, not trained to come back to
A place were we chant valor, while they sleep between towers
surrender to grant power to contracts that advance cowards

Never mind how platoons raked bodies over coals
left boulders over roads, deaths overt odor rose
to remind me how my story was over blown
All glory to metropoles, with divine overtones
A dmz as Demarcation, EMTs restart patients
resuscitate each heart pacing, we all die slow in isolation

My neighbors locked and loaded they scared to be frightened of unknowns when
thermo-siphons can longer keep out cold winds from flowing
 
No faith tomorrow comes after the setting of the sun
Freeze our zygotes, delete our files, we can restart what we've done
Can we estimate timescales, how much we probably got
Peel back veneers to reveal cankers and Colony rot

We move as one, what has been, what will become
Less apparent, these errant projections of elysium
From dots of quantum to paper free of typos
Replication fidelity equals keys to survival
These beast also speak through our dreams as we sleep
Where we seek relief, where we pay homage to our deceased
To master entropy they must be free to reach sovereigns
breach deep sea territories, make extinct dolphins

My team boosted, we raise our own as captives
i only detect faintly when my timeline matches
With their rumblings, often, I'm within colossi shadows
they lumbering forwards, towards more unaligned backbones

Mormons vs Lutheran's unlike poorest verse super rich
Identities shape behavior, hyper-egos as a crucifix
for a proven niche, It's all about the mind share
They moving with as they find more to do with us
A human unit, atomized to be recombined
We don't deify what we can't see and what we keep inside

Parts of a whole, we like parts of a whole
One cell in a organism that's neither carbon or bone
We parts of many entities that all offer a home
To symbolic comprehensions we can call it our own
Parts of a whole, we like parts of a whole
Just cell of organisms neither carbon or bone
We parts of many entities that all offer a home
To symbolic comprehensions we can call them our own

from pressurized gas to liquid acetylene
Each method varies in molecule assembly
Humans store energy potentials to power many things
Colossi is a level above matter that controls machines
So the dominant propagate Fructose delivery
Which interact as liver fat that spread to peripheries
We now susceptible to crave short bursts of meaning
It seems the thirst of demons need us hurt and fiending

Colossi roam another world but they cause ripples in our space
they coordinate massive efforts to secure coordinates
This is half a decade since Peabody crashed
but still there's fly ash on lilacs beside streams next to shafts
it's extreme how they tapped eons to keep alight beacons
Banish nights so the industrial complex increases
I'm part of life forms separating earth into pieces
Divide and conquers each while replacing all other species

Parts of a whole, we like parts of a whole
One cell in a organism neither carbon or bone
We parts of many entities that all offer a home
To symbolic comprehensions we can call it our own
Parts of a whole, we like parts of a whole
One cell in a organisms that's neither carbon or bone
We parts of many entities that all offer a home
To symbolic comprehensions we can call them our own

with weather patterns disturbed, it's perfect for merchants to continue searching
for uncharted routes through the north pole to earn they reimbursements
From Young minds in Cali guided by VCs
valleys of silicon ideate new treatise
who affords to peer beyond time horizons
Allocate efforts to disseminate and accord science findings
Individuals, or are we minuscule?
Each life a fleeting sequence inside of unending interludes
affiliates, networked, optimized, for when it really gets
to points of a histories we ain't feeling yet
It's no surprise how they attack eccentrics
want you to regress back to centrists, or they won't cap your sentence
25 to life for thought crimes leave you thrashed or deadened
All threats trigger cascading immune defenses as will as ruthless severance

If your views are toxic to the usual topics, then
Meeting antibodies of gigantic bodies is your future prospect
And if you don't evade, then you'll be erased
you'll be retrained or you'll be replaced, you'll be reclaimed
No matter, akin to skin shed through metabolism
Colossi live on appetites that extract our sentience

Parts of a whole, we like parts of a whole
Just cell of organism neither carbon or bone
We parts of many entities that all offer a home
To symbolic comprehensions we can call it our own
Parts of a whole, we like parts of a whole
One cell in a organisms neither carbon or bone
We parts of many entities that all offer a home
To symbolic comprehensions we can call them our own

Fall into holes or walled and enclosed
When you feel the immense presence you either dwarfed or exposed
How do you fight gods when you resonate as material
We can lash at each each other but can't scratch ethereal
Forgotten bodies atop bedrock buried at Battle crossings
If you wanna fight the system? Might as well be shadow boxing
Human beings, we capable of as parts of a whole
Nothing's destined as net negatives for hearts that are full

Human beings, we do live in shadows of Giants
The fractals remind us that it's not natural to merely grapple with tyrants
My team boosted, we raise our own as captives
We combined our minds to put forth life into practice
Systems only change when another system replaces
We build within ruins with what we find in the encasing
Colossi are the sum of us, bigger than anyone one of us
We raise our own to be aware when and where they summon us
	
What's beneath the surface, corpses of many murdered servants
mass graves of ones who were here before us
at dusk, we utter their names as a silent chorus
brush aside bloodshed as well as violent torture
no peace on stolen land, we reach with swollen hands
at golden sands slipping through cracks, no hope for man
They flooded the lower ninth to save the upper wards
dynamite to crumbling levies just one way to fuck the poor
we barter oppression to commodify who suffers more
The shock front, no options for us under war

To refugees, running for your life, find your way
To prisoners of conscious, escape the firing range
To all peoples, who have to live under climate change
This crisis isn't normal, we just forced to fight the flames

The current state of the union produces actions that are ruthless
armed factions of vigilantes on the look out for looters
blood in the sewers, race riots, this how they do us
every four years, a hero myth is how they fool us
these tunnels we prepare, lined with metal piping
we hasten our steps to avoid foul air, squint through poor lighting
gotta reach day break but the path wont stay straight
our life depreciates with the falling exchange rates
we duck down to bide time, but struck down and side lined
bodies wash out at high tide, reflection of high crime
to counter radiation we eating iodine
through spectacle, in plain views to hide they crimes
mass panic over bread, they institute martial law
giving birth to resistance modeled off the art of war
precinct slaughter all, M16s cut like Islamic swords
feeding off of death, some sort of carnivore

to ensure safety we secure our own transmissions
speaking enigma over lines they tap and listen
they trap and imprison, slash, bash in our dominion
not hesitant to suppress uprisings and black sedition
Our pasts are given, but it seems that our futures shifted
it's not in their interest to keep our spirits lifted

To the refugees, running for your life, find your way
To prisoners of conscience, escape the firing range
To all peoples, who have to suffer climate change
This crisis isn't normal, we just forced to fight the flames

suspicious of our autonomy,  how we live consciously
corroding their control through organic technology
grow our own food so Monsanto not profiting
set up our own school, defend against false prophecy
polish our own jewels, acknowledge our own rules
harvest our own energy, sharpen our own tools
know who is the enemy, believe our own destiny
war has 2 sides when we maintain our own identity
Remain beneath suspicion for now to avoid attrition
photovoltaics on roofs top drive hydroponic systems
methane from bio reactors got the pot hissing
all the surplus we keep in the cellar or the kitchen
cant reach the masses cause the scales pale in comparison
itll be years before the facade starts wearing thin

Wave lengths broadcasts to sell ideals mad direct
achieving homogeneity with mass effect, overrun with pacifists
people gather beneath the Golden arches
feeding their kids carbs and frozen starches
flesh from carcasses more tarnished than the tar pits
send the waste out to space in metal barges
this ain't no way to live, we sooner waste our gifts
than weigh the amount we need to repay what we've missed
every achievement is fodder for next election
they offer more protection, but instead opt for more depression
every victory we bleed for is short lived
tomorrow is morbid when history is poorly written
Memories fade while nature erodes the evidence
how can we Excel if we're Surrounded by precedent

how do we prevail if we confounded by pestilence
can't achieve excellence when we buried underneath sediments

To the refugees, running for your life, find your way
To prisoners of conscious, escape the firing range
To all peoples, who have to live with climate change
This crisis isn't normal, we just forced to fight and pray

The shock fronts is more than troop divisions
or nukes and what we doing with them, its every ruthless dictum
its that spy satellite panopticon supervision
its that looping news segment, about soup kitchen nutrition
its fossil fuels, its prescription drug induced sickness
its the crucifixion against truth and wisdom

its pollution that scales cause science is superstition
Lucid visions with no use to mention
Surrender just live in their perfect fantasy
Whatever the famine brings, we can manage things
Surrender to the shock or fight to stop the calamity
our lives are front lines in this war for humanity
	
Its difficult to roam not exposed to signs of recruitment
everywhere multitudes partake in modern communions
among the ruins, glass facades frame institutions
built upon quicksand, they still want to expand

The marble around me, colder than mountains its stripped from
language I speak, contains colonial logic in dictums
fruits I eat, coated chemically like trees it was picked from
engineered to grow thick skin to survive prescriptions
hydrocarbons shape shifted to battle insect resistance
infected with sickness by clicks who oversee business interests
shipped over seas or imported, makes no difference
now that we devoid of seasonals, there ain't no limits

To rise above it all, we create god in our own image, we don't mention finite suddenly has no limits, we don't finish what been started, bring to market modern curses, full speed towards the furnace, is this actually worth it?
To rise above it all, we create god in our own image, we don't mention finite suddenly has no limits, we don't finish what been started, merchants market modern curses, you buy to fight the current, but is this actually worth it?

millions converted to images of white models and movie actors
return billions in profit for skin bleach and Hair relaxers
its unseen, yet showers the earth like sunbeams
struggle to cover up multiple nightmares with one dream
of utopia, found in fields of opium
Found in shields of policemen
Found in buildings folding in after tectonics opening
found in electronic potency that amps up dopamine
Found in empty fountains, found in expansive postal grids
subliminal messages, how we supposed to live
slipping false dichotomies like testosterone verse estrogen
look out through port holes
either fields of corn rows or a city of human morsels
a false prophesy foretold from a mouth of a cynic
self fulfilled prophecies are supposed to be cyclic
modern mystics traverse elevated sidewalks lifted off the district
look out to the distance, buildings attempt the heavens with mere ascension
dependent only upon the weakest weld or rivet
I guess it's a given that this systems got no limits
 
To rise above it all, we create god in our own image
we don't mention finite suddenly has no limits
we don't finish what been started,  bring to market modern curses
full speed towards the furnace, is this actually worth it?
To rise above it all, we create god in our own image
we don't mention finite suddenly has no limits
we don't finish what been started, merchants bring to market modern curses
you buy to fight the current, is this actually worth it?

I'm trying change the system while they try to change the climate
set up hierarchy for you to climb it, while they consolidate combining
Bad men who got your mattress bugged live in a world where atlas shrugged
Sweep through laws that strafe like Gatling guns
what happens after the suns blackened, nihilist fashion gains traction, nautilus takes action
how we move forward if we trapped in silos and don't learn
its like arson to their prisons, concrete don't burn
on bomb beats, Naut competes with noise that constructs towards infinity, churned out by industries and delivered individually
the past is unwritten, our futures can be different
renounce their myths and image, and recognize our limits

We exist in constant motion, elicit bonds unbroken
we links of chains that stretch back to before beginnings of our omens

I bow before the sun above, pray for rains to ward the flood
I'm the remains of those who lived and loved
In this city, you balance id and ego ratios
it's appetite is insatiable for the nameless

whole lineages cut short by highways, epidemics
by pipeline extensions, a planets lifeline is ended
a night time suspended by lights and moving traffic
we try so hard to move fast but to me we moving backwards
The GDP don't mean anything when we get by through any means
survival among enemies guarantees conflict eventually
it was all was envisioned in the architects decision

create nation state monuments and structures that cage women
yoke the labor class to gas and grease the pistons
wear down our defenses to promote and spread the sickness
consume to validate your existence, re-calibrate to established norms set forth by magazine subscriptions

all the while oblivious to the living hell
this citadel is just physical its our mind that's the prison cell

Oblivious to the living hell, this citadel is physical its our mind that's the prison cell
Few of us living well, fewer will live to tell, the sick and frail don't make it within the citadel

Travel via roof tops, the view unravels like loose knots
advertisement produce wants
we opt in to shop so no need to cut the coupons
we stopping to gawk at  fads that have already moved on
the horizon lays bare all its wasted potential
from up here its clear the sprawl is exponential
a sea of sheet metal, no peace at street level
police appease devils, more heat than tea kettles
inside the mayhem, legacy of Ronny Reagan
witness the last days of failed civilization, weak and strong
all are hurt within the melee
stay away from Windows and Men donning the black face paint
organized groups who choose to embrace hate
no where to turn, we have no examples to learn,

Before it destroys them they internalize the poison, through their bodies and then homelands it be coursing
Protectors of privilege, not of the innocent
target the outcast, demonize immigrants, we penalize differences
no caskets on the daily news, drone attacks on schools are rarely viewed
a culture of violence will turn on itself eventually
for most this is a spectacle, for some it's their destiny
a culture of violence will turn on itself
its from within comes the fall of the citadel
	
The market crashes, spells doom for the starving masses
who breathe in fumes from the garbage patches
the mega-projects funded by lender prospects
end up abandoned at the end of the tail end of returning comets

drain rivers into flood plains, so silos have enough grain
but rains come no more so we war over unnamed
sources of nourishment, convert fossils to heat
which turns water to steam, in turn fires the beams
of light reflected and interpreted controlling machines
which starts the process over the world over, just as a means


To see the end, what it seems to me is to see the start
A new beginning, this world's ending, but I play a part
What is here tomorrow depends on what i build today
The present the informs the future, its the past that leads the way

Drones In the sky as democracy in disguise
The history they revise so atrocity is reprised
when all is said and done its that they fear a brown planet
script new narratives to construct the brown phantoms
A hidden Menace, like bullets from a smith and Wesson
end trains of thought which reveal the missing lessons
kingdoms of the Kushite threaten faces that don't look right
ancient Pre-Islamic civilizations which took flight

from math to martial arts, stacking higher forts
crafting iron way before they ever did in the global north
part of human legacy erased by modern agendas
ones that keeps 99 percent out of Mensa

one that pits materialists against those who bow towards mecca
plots to distract from how every species ends up
as a memory, remember you can't fight entropy
the Universe is far from our worst enemy

To see the end, what it seems to me is to see the start
A new beginning, this world's ending, but I play a part
What is here tomorrow depends on what i build today
The present the informs the future, so its the past that leads the way

Core samples from deep under tundra, no relief from the
dissonance, the sickness is  between the rings in lumber
the atmosphere is changing, from concrete in foundations
bombings of Eurasia, slash and burn farming in tribal nations
forced to compete with mechanized systems of extraction
armed factions grabbing Land, attack with AKs verse they javelins

the end of the old ways, Defense of the modern
Last of the cold days, The past will be slaughtered
as the oceans rise from massive glaciers melting
calcium carbonate will be stripped from the shellfish
another record of days before lost to the ether
have we crossed beyond no return, to be buried in the deep earth

To see the end, what it seems to me is to see the start
A new beginning, this world's ending, but I play a part
What is here tomorrow depends on what i build today
The present the informs the future, so its the past that leads the way

The past leads the way, We can't afford to resist reason
cease and desist they drafts to eclipse the sun
with oxides of aluminum, influencing flux
the beacons they construct with plasma providing the thrust
a spec in the cosmos, onward towards regions of dust
elemental particles which are the basis of us
Deep imaging to pierce the darkness back into time
our minds reflect, deconstruct the numbers back into primes
We asking many questions but are we masking our crimes
nothing lasts forever, are we the last of our kind
	
Its been hypothesized, human survival is paramount
our genetic sequence is what we care about
And not even, only a small part our species if that
They need structures intact to continue immortal syntax
They build rockets now, wait til they find deposits on the asteroids,
At the same time, they mine helium from gas voids
Virtual ques to secure appointments, space for enjoyment, 
really just preparation for near space deployment

Who'll hit the first trillion, while we all thirst for resilience
Sand storms assault our eyes as we compete as civilians
My DNA as a resume, will beta rays break my endocrine
how suited am I for labor behind ceramics and metal plates
It's clear at my levels of bone density I'm meant to be 
a sub contractor, low earth orbit intensity
Assigned to space debris, one week with safety teams
I'm on call, my contingent on shipments to supply space Marines

Seasonal work for the rootless, we're born to roam
Get contacted via haptics to meet at the Corner Stone
Merchants near the docks bargain in Esperanto
under shipping container condos, slipping each other envelopes
I coming down the slope, I see my unit down below
Suited up with IOI, company palindrome

It's apparent there's been mission change
I see rockets meant for long precision range
on the docks taxiing , I hear the squad lead saying:

We found water on Mars, the time is definitely ours
Skies the limit so its time to reach for the stars
We seek power on the frontier, opportunity as prophecy
Water on Mars, we found our new profit stream

Without clearance for working off world I'll be paid off the books
Effectively a stowaway, so my employers off the hook
Avoiding Zenet carcasses as we set course towards the moon
Gravity sling shot over settlements of maroons

The first pioneers, technicians to service machines for entire years
Lessons learn from the second biosphere
From Moon dust, silica was refined and moved up
Founders and shareholders recouped before the boom bust
Even guilds won't repatriate due to fiscal necessity
You die with your specialty, contractual destiny

From portholes we see strip mines raking a lunar surface
Sun rays bake it, Bone dry, inhospitable to those who work it
On the dark side now it's an infinite night
I sit back to bathe in pitch black before we lifting the kite

Nuclear detonation directed for flight
Shut my eyes and engage *hibernation as I dream of the sight
 
Of water on Mars, the time is definitely ours
Skies the limits so it's time to reach for the Stars
We seek power on the frontier, opportunity as prophecy
Water on Mars, we found our new profit stream

Florescents burn holes in the evening
Local Lexicons are permutations of business English
We fed Iodine by higher minds
Lack of magnetic fields endanger us at higher climbs
Laser levels guide taps into glaciers, obscured by vapors in craters
Uncertain dangers, as we operate base camp on Syrtus major

I'm seeing floaters as they Fly to the side of my eyes
Remote medicine assure me fatigue is just a sign of the times
8 hour shifts not guaranteed I never signed on the line
Passing Memorials for colleagues who died in the mines

News travels fast due to a record quarter
A gold rush fueled by stress at borders, Cape Verde to California
Waves of immigration promised a new life
Replace populations who live in drains and sewer pipes
So while we reach for the sick, corporations battle with cease and desist
I'm on my second evening shift as I leap deep into mist

We found water on Mars, the time is definitely ours
The space race ain't race based, it's a quest for no cowards
We seek power on the frontier, opportunity as prophecy
Water on Mars, we found our new profit stream
water on Mars, the time is definitely ours
The space race ain't race based, it's a quest for no cowards
We seek power on the frontier, opportunity as prophecy
Water on Mars, we found our new profit stream

I'm watching info feeds from an overcrowded sickbay
I don't got no sick days so they lock me down by the wrist brace

VR recordings show harvests of the last sycamores
Between commercials broadcast second American civil war
My bones have turned hollow, powdered food is hard to swallow
Its harder to follow which nation states have been toppled

Back on Earth they rationing water by the bottle
crops die as cops fly above riots in Davos
Wusulis last drops compel ruso-sino death spiral
Russia resurrects R 23 Kartechs, to punctures textiles
Nuclear war in the sky, I see it from where I lie, with my eyes
ICBMs roar with final battle cries
We lost our home market, I'm just a lone carcass
The price we pay to strike unknown bargains


We find water on Mars, the countdown definitely starts
The space race ain't isolated, we run from whatever we are
Seek new meanings on the frontier, but won't reach escape velocity
Water on Mars, we are driven to spread atrocity

We find water on Mars, the countdown definitely starts
The space race ain't new, and we won't get far
Seek new meanings on the frontier, but won't reach escape velocity
Water on Mars, we race to spread atrocity
	
Approach the final frontier, deep horizons warped by iron cores
sun flares lash across abyss, contact leviathans
gas giants pummeled by ice and diamonds, titans rising
No information escapes from beyond event horizons
we look up, take notes of when points of light in alignment
Equations deduce trajectories, magnitudes produce time shifts

redness off in the spectrum, divide the sky into sections
focus stacked lenses towards precise directions
The wave lengths reaching our eyes hint at an increasing in size
boundaries distinct from the sides of the regions we spy
this might be the reasons for why
we not overstanding our shallow contexts and the deepness of mind

Look around for evidence, we got reasons to doubt
They books, they sentences that say we got the freedom to bow
The Known Universe too deep for the evil and foul
Overstand we living lives we ain't even dreaming about

Through modes of control a few be certain that worth be in the holding of gold
having faith that value retained equals the value its sold
but what value remains on a planet that's cold
take for granted that the damage can managed in full

global perspectives block out the total recessions
not financial markets, I'm talking bout artificial selection
genocide in the tropics, what survives are solely parasites
filling voids and niches of what once was paradise
we extract the final tracks of intact biomass
Then latch on with tyrant grasps that impact with violent wrath
Developments of narco-architecture, gardens with artful renders
western standards, ratios ain't hard to measure
satellite rings, surround a darkened center
setting concrete emits carbon as it hardens the earth

now when rains pour, aquifers no longer replenish
original cultures washed away are no longer mentioned
Top soil depletion cause food prices to peak
riots over grain,  strong leech off the weak just eat
warring over water will be deemed proactive
off shore drilling coupled with fractures as standard practice
a belief that to be human is to increase extraction
look up into blackness, metal spines weave a caged lattice
a belief that to be human is to be extractive
its not our biology that keeps us captive

Look around for evidence, we got reasons to doubt,
They books, they sentences that say we got the freedom to bow
The Known Universe too deep for the evil and foul
Overstand we living lives we ain't even dreaming About

Were we meant to construct metropolis with slum quarters attached
boom bust cycles, with property taxes to match
we pay to live, they take, we give to exist upon grey acres
this calculation less logical than pascals wager
what seems Megalithic, nautilus beg the difference
though its hard to contradict armed men with killer instincts
or neo shamans that cast more dreams than Sega systems
while ours elders die slow in federal prison

they want us second guessing, package problems as solutions
military augment police to decrease deaths from shooting
ethical slaughter, guiltless meat sold to consumers
banish the night, block out the sky with urban light pollution
don't mix the true dark up with layers of shadow
who controls the facts yo, contradictions we must grapple
as long as we keep vibing, our people keep surviving
the known has shown light upon the deep horizons
